Digital Ascension was created to help people. Our goal is to deliver premium information technology services to our clients using the best software on the market, but we don't want to stop there. Digital Ascension is heavily invested in open-source and we are building tools that anyone can use, free of charge.
If you have browsed some of the services that we offer, you may have noticed that a lot of the software that we work with is open-source. At Digital Ascension, we believe that open-source software is beneficial for two reasons: 1. Most large open-source projects have communities that can help you if you run into issues. 2. Open-source software allows you to view and edit the code, giving you a large amount of freedom and flexibility. Our goal is create open-source tools that work well with the software that we support. This also includes tools for closed-source software, such as Windows or your favorite cloud provider.
If you would like to take a look at the work Digital Ascension is doing in the open, I would encourage you to check out our GitHub: https://github.com/digitalascension. And as always, please feel free to make a pull request! We are always looking for contributions from the Digital Ascension community.
